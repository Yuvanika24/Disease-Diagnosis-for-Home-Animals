**Skin Disease Classifier**

Skin Disease Classifier is a deep learning project aimed at accurately classifying various types of skin diseases from images. 
This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify skin disease images into one of five classes: 
'BUMPS', 'HAIR LOSS', 'HOT SPOTS', 'RASHES', or 'SORES'.

**Key Features**

**Image Classification**: 
The project allows users to upload an image of a skin disease, and the trained model predicts the most probable class of the disease.

**Model Training**: 
The deep learning model is trained using a dataset containing images of different skin diseases.

**Model Evaluation**: 
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using a separate testing dataset to ensure its generalization ability.

**Graphical Visualization**: 
The training progress of the model is visualized through plots showing accuracy and loss over epochs.
